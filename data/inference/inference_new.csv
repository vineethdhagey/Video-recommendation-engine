excellent tutorial the visuals were great
i loved spending an hour just to get to the main point brilliant pacing
oh yes very clear i totally understand how that works now what a masterpiece
the instructor explained the formula clearly and effectively
i feel much more confident about the topic now
a solid explanation of a complex subject
the content was a bit advanced but still very useful
i appreciate the effort put into this lesson
my brain cells are having a party of pure confusion this is top-tier education
the audio quality is so bad i can barely hear what the instructor is saying
the presenter just reads off the slides this isnt teaching
i feel like i know less now than i did before watching this confusing mess
it was just another video in the series nothing unexpected
this is a suitable introductory video for people unfamiliar with the concept
the facts presented seem to be accurate based on what i already know
