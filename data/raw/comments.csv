"The brace being after the function name makes absolutely zero sense.
Imagine the fact that since function names are different so is the length of their name thus they change so the bracket will almost always be in a different place if you place it after the function's name, making it easy to miss, not all compilers (this is not java specific) might specify what the missing error might be if you do so, they usually only indicate the line they think the error is (and that's not always the case anyway) so the rest is up to you to figure out, that's why we always put it below the function name because we know it's statically placed on the same place every time so we know where to find it, very easily if missed in the first place.",negative
"I find the solution to FizzBuzz could have ultilized Switch statements, by assigning a key value to each conditional checks. I would prefer this over the repeated if/else checks due to it completely avoid nested if, and also DRY compliant.

  for(int i = fruits.length - 1; i >= 0; i--)",neutral

P - parenthesis
M - multiplication
D -  division
A - addition
S - subtraction

Your explanations are very clear and simple. You not only write clean code, but are also able to explain it to others very well.

"Actually .. I wanted to say something.😮
For anyone looking to buy rest of the course,this advise is for them.

I have personally bought and tried the course. So i think i am eligible to tell my opinion.

While the beginners' part is very good and easy to understand for the beginners it may make most of  them to buy this course.
But the game changes after this. The course in the paid version from oops and onwards is hell lot of (not neccessarily bad but..) not as expected. It is very difficult and you will het no context of what he is saying and why he did that portion of code even if you mastered the fundementals class of his.

I personally think it was his plan the whole time to give the best and easy part for free in youtube to make everyone who liked it and buy his course. Then they will regret it after buying and the refund option is absolutely bullshit(i never got it back).

I initially thought that it is my problem that i couldnt understand. So i watched the beginners video for like 4-5 times and coding along.But nothing changed. As i told the context completely get missing and he mostly dont tell why he wrote that piece of code and what it does clearly.
Also very later the accent gets annoying if to be honest(this statement is just personal option and experience).

So i wouldnt recommend at all for a paid course. But this beginners guide is very good.(probably due to the reason i mentioned earlier).

PS.
I dont want to create or promote  any kind of hate. I just wanted the folks to know what i experienced and dont want them to waste the money.

Edit:
I also see some few people praising the paid course as well but i think they are just lying and most of them havent even bought it to be honest. Not that it IS..but most probably.

Thank you.😅",positive

anyone in the comments struggling don't really understand java at like 55 or 17 minutes in if you had trouble like me I started with some easier exercises online before doing the mortgage calculator but once you understand its pretty easy I also found it a lot easier when you focus on learning one language instead of trying to do what I did at one point trying to learn multiple languages at once.

"What started off as a website that let users upload images of menus from their favorite restaurants for others to refer to built by two techies from IIT Delhi in 2008, quickly skyrocketed and transformed into the king of the food delivery industry we now know as Zomato In 2022, Zomato has over 80 million users, 1.4 million listed restaurants and operates in around 24 countries worldwide. Zomato enjoyed complete monopoly in the food delivery and restaurant discovery industry for the most part and enjoyed a massive market share of 72%. This all changed however during the recent Covid 19 pandemic.


Swiggy, a small food delivery company founded in 2014 was slowly making a name for itself over the years and by


a chain reaction of unprecedented events, overtook Zomato as the leading company in the food delivery industry.


For a company that ruled the sector for years with no competition whatsoever, this came as a shock to Zomato which now had a meagre 43% market share compared to Swiggy's 44% How could a company that's smaller and has been around for a lot less time achieve something so monumental? Zomato went on to bring in KPMG to investigate the same and help them turn the situation around to reclaim their throne as quickly as possible


When the KPMG team looked closely at Zomato's performance, financials and operating strategies, it was clear where the company was lacking when compared to its competitor. The main areas of concern discovered by the team were, user experience, app UI and UX, delivery inconsistencies employee and unsatisfactory support and complaint addressal The team went on to provide possible solutions for all these problems and subjected them to several testing methods such as the action priority matrix and RAC index to explore feasibility and conformity to rules and regulations The Zomato team was interviewed as well to understand the employees views and thoughts on the situation as its essential to approach the issue from both angles


This consulting project proved to be an essential activity to understand the prerequisites and complexities of a food delivery giant",positive

"*For anyone who wants a little harder version of Mortgage Calculator, using Function and Arguments to make the code precise*

I am coming from Python, so I knew I could make it even shorter using Functions!

How I did Mortgage Calculator (Part-2) is as below, suggest me on how could I further improve this as I am still new to Java Language!

        // Calculating the Mortgage:

"Around minute 41:

Point point1 = new Point(x:1, y:1);

It is very frustrating as a beginner when tutorial examples don't work but feels good when I can work it out. With OpenJDK11 and OpenJDK19, this line generates 9 errors. Some examples:

')' or ',' expected
not a statement
';' expected
Cannot resolve symbol 'x'
Cannot resolve symbol 'y'
Unexpected token [which appears to refer to the colons in the assignments]

This is the code that ended up working on OpenJDK19, thanks to hints from Java itself:

"So, I'm on the latest version of Java SE and IntelliJ (2022). When I start a project, it allows me to choose JAVA and the JDK 18.0.2, then ""create""... but it doesn't allow me to select ""Command Line App"" or choose a base package, and so, the project opens as a (.iml) file instead of a package or java file. So, in IntelliJ, I'm editing text on a .iml and cannot find anything that allows me to open a new project as a .java or create a new package.",neutral
"one thing that always confuses me is how different, different IDE's can be,
for example in high school I have IT as a subject and we learn java from text books
we use the jGrasp IDE. When you open the IDE you just click on new file and then declare class names, then you can save the file in a folder.
there is no base package
it doesn't have a project panel with a hiachry of folders such as project folder and then source code folder within that and then a base package folder in that and then within that the main class. Its just one folder wherein you write all your classes.
the way the school teaches is slow and limiting which is why I want to learn from online as well.

Edit : I can add code at the top of the folder to say what package the class is in before declaring the class but different ides can be confusing to switch around",negative

"Hi Mosh, I saw your java tight and loose coupling video. I had certain doubts in loose coupling watched several youtube video and article but still couldn't grasp certain points. I will explain what i understood and what confuses me . In loose coupling we restrict the direct coupling between classes. But in tight coupling we are bound to classes. Let's take an example. I have one Main class and another different class with the name Apple. I am creating instance of any of this class in Main class by 

Apple apple =new Apple();
//Apple is tightly coupled to Main class

apple.eat();
//If eat method signature is Changed to drink in the Apple class ofcourse we need to change the method name here also right?.

Let's see loose 

class interface Fruits{
void drink();
}

Class Apple implements Fruits {
@Override
public void drink (){
Printing some message;
}
}

class Main{
public static void main(String [] args){
Fruits apple = new Apple ();
//loose coupled ??
apple.drink();
}
}

If i Change the method signature in loose coupling from drink to pour . I need to change the code in 3 different places.
1. method signature inside Fruits interface(drink to pour)
2.class Apple(method override from drink to pour)
3.inside Main class(method call from apple.drink to apple.pour)

What's the point of using loose coupling here. In tight coupling once I modify the coupled class(Apple) i am forced to update the Main class. In loose coupling also I am doing the same process .what's the point of using it. 

The only benefit that I can feel through loose coupling is the interface reference type .for example

Tight coupling code 

Main class{
//boiler plate code

Apple apple = new Apple();
}

In future if i create Mango class i need to create another object in Main class like Mango mango = new Mango();

Loose coupling code

Main class{
//boiler plate code
Fruits apple =new Apple():
//In future if i Change Apple() to Mango() no error will occur here because of the reference type(Fruits). 

}

"Little review of his full course: Great intro course. I bought the full course on his website. It's pretty good. 
But I find that after the intro course, it gets really confusing because Mosh works backwards (to my brain).
He writes code then changes it completely (refactors) and teaches how and why to change that code. 

As the course progresses, I find this really hard to make sense of and keep track of the changes that he is talking about. I would personally prefer starting with a fresh example every time instead of constantly changing the code already present. It's as if I get to a point and think, ""oh ok, I get it!"" and it's then revealed that, ""no.. this is not the way!""  Haha.

I love his enthusiasm and delivery. The videos are really well made. The code font size is too big and I find it harder to keep track of what he's working on. 

But, that's just me. His method may work super well for you!",positive

Nice explanation.,neutral
isnt the for loop at @2:21:54 incorrect? It should be int i = fruits.length-1 instead of int i = fruits.length because the length is 3 but there is not index 3? so it would make the out of bounds error? and the condition should be i >= 0 because you want to display the first element. i am just trying to learn and make sure! i loved your tutorial so much you taught me more in 2 and half hours than i did in an entire semester of java,negative

"Thanks so much for this Mosh. I hope you don't mind me pointing out a bug in your reverse iterative for loop at 2:21:14. You'll get an index out of range (as length returns the cardinality of the array, but the index goes only up to length minus one since it starts from zero). Also, by using strictly greater than operator, you will stop short of the last item (first element of the array in reverse list). To fix, please change to for (int i = fruits.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) followed by your print statement.",neutral

"Though I appreciate how you are making the first part of the course free for all, there are a few things that could make your class easier to understand:
1. avoid using jargon and terms that you have not yet explicitly explained. (Unless you already have previous knowledge of at least some programming, you would have to guess or google it in order to understand, which interrupts learning.)
2. try not to introduce templates or even intelliJ in the beginning. it's like learning physics. just giving students a formula and ask students to plug things in doesn't help students understand how the world works and the relationships among various variables. likewise, templates might be useful and save time later on, but in the beginning, these things only make things even more complicated and hinder understanding of the basics.
3. explain the big picture first followed by each part according to how it works and why it works that way, then give examples. for example, it would be much easier to understand if you introduced package first, then class and function/method. and it would be better if you introduced why the package is ordered in the way it is. it would also be extremely helpful to go over every part of every line, like how each much end in a certain way, with ; or {}, and the way parameters work, since they are a crucial part of the class. for example, it would be much easier if you started off blank, then explain each part as you type things in, instead of loading up a template.",positive

"@Programming with Mosh greek people do say P and not Pi, but we read another way. So, letter P becomes Π, and letter i becomes ι (same letter without the dot). The ""full name"" of the letter Π is Πι (the same way that letter's A ""full name"" is Alpha (greek Άλφα). Now if you translate Πι to english you end up with Pi. Then, if you do it the other way and traslate Pi to greek letters P becomes Π but now i becomes ""άι"" (so  Pi becomes Πάι and we read it as 2 syllables( Πά - ι ).

long story short if you translate P you get Πι, and if you translate Pi you get Πάι.

Pro tip: You need to put the dot on top of the letter Α because the letters Α + Ι combine to make Ε (you don't write E but you read E when you see AI ).

Πάι translates to Pi (Πάι 2 syllables Πά - ι )
Παι translates to Pe (Παι 1 syllable)

"Optimize Macro to run faster – Tips 1
[I will post total 7 Tips one by one so that post is not too long]

When you update Cells manually or through Excel Macro, Excel does these functions automatically. These tasks take some time, though less than second. As you perform hundred tasks in a Macro, the run time will be longer. So you can speed up Macro this way. Create 2 Events and then use the first one at the start of you Macro and the second at the end of your Macro.
You may run several sub-routines in one run. You should use this Sub in the main Sub.

Sub DisableExcelFunctions()
Application. DisplayStatusBar = False
Application.ScreenUpdating = False
Applicaion.EnableEvents= False
Application.Calculation = XlCalculationManual
End Sub

Sub EnableExcelFunctions()
Application. DisplayStatusBar = True
Application.ScreenUpdating = True
Applicaion.EnableEvents= True
Application.Calculation = xlCalculationAutomatic
End Sub

Take care of this:
Application.Calculation = XlCalculationManual
If you use this, then you must use Range.Calculate Function in your Macro. Because you may need calculated result in the same Macro.
Sample:
TargetSheet.Range(""L31"").Formula = ""=SUM(F31:K31)""
TargetSheet.Range(""L31"").Copy
TargetSheet.Range(""L31:L42"").FillDown
TargetSheet.Range(""L31:L42"").Calculate

So if it is divisible by both:  n = 3(5j) = 15j ==> it is divisible by 15.",neutral

I fell asleep several times while watching, but persistently tried to look further and understand. At the end of the course, I could not say that I did not understand something. But at the same time, I still did not understand how this information can help me to do programming. Mosh said that it is not necessary to immediately memorize all these commands that he demonstrates. Well, I didn't remember, and I don't understand what to do next.
I don't seem to be a fool. I myself have been an ITguy for many years. But apparently the programming is not mine. I kept expecting some kind of catharsis, but thinking about programming I feel like I am in outer space, where each star is your working tool.
It seems to me that a programming course for beginners should include not only an abundance of commands (which no one will remember), but a way to understand what this toolkit is all about. 
If you are an painter, your tools are brushes and paints. If you are a musician, your tool is a musical instrument, with not that many strings, keys, or valves. What is a programmer's toolkit? A million commands and a million combinations of them? What should I understand (learn?) to be able to write my own programs?
But, maybe, I'm a fool after all. Sadness and sorrow.",positive

I was actually able to learn other things extremely fast with how powerful intellij along with java is. But, at 2:21:50 (around there) you have for ( int i = fruits.length; i> 0; i--) , this actually brings up a runtime error because the absolute length of the string is indexed literally ie starting from 1 instead of 0. The code that works instead is:
for (int i = fruits.length-1; i >= 0 ; i--){

"Love your courses Mosh and I agree ""clean coding"" is super important.  Learned indenting in the 80's.  Python enforces such.  At first I hated that then I just accepted people will not write clean code so Python forces it.  However in my opinion things like ternary operators versus if then else, and other specific language ""things"" are actually not what distinguish the pro from the amateur.  It's about algorithms.  Think, Google Maps, the ""shortest path"" algorithm (graph data structures) which they then incorporate traffic, the ability to write heap sorts, AVL balanced binary trees, etc. is what separates top programmers from beginners/armatures.  They also do not break DRY, DRY refers to using ""sub routines now called procedures"", ""objects"" etc. to do something and to always use that ""routine/class"" to do that thing.  That thing should be singular and specific but that's another story.

 I don't know if u will see this comment. But I'm doing it anyway.I followed the entire video for 3 weeks before commenting here. It’s  gonna be a long comment. 

This video covered a lot a basics, undoubtedly, quite good for beginners like me. But I do find some faults here,compared to other tutorials on youtube, if u don't  mind.

No details discussion & example on
1. Methods & functions, string split, arguments.
2. Multiple classes & objects in a project.
 I know you have two other video courses in this, namely OOP & Advanced on java. I haven’t watched them as they're paid & I'm unable to buy those. 
You are doing a great job. But providing basic & incomplete knowledge for free in a video does more harm than good, though I know it’s for beginners.

Hello Mosh sir . You are great .I have learnt python and java from you till now .I am not as old for qualifying a developer's job but really I have learnt this much from you that I am sure that if i give a interview I will  definitely qualify .You are excellent and dedicated .You also left your job for teaching us. You are  a genius but my only concern is that being  a small boy I cannot pay for your paid courses and I have to keep myself limited to a beginner . Please look over this matter and solve it .Please.....,positive

"2:20:00 If you are using an array length in your for statement conditional and you know the length is not supposed to change, it's best practice to define it as a constant beforehand. Every loop will cause the app to access the array again to get length. And if length changes unintentionally within a loop, you will get strange results or loop infinitely.",neutral
"Here's a solution to the FizzBuzz problem that's dry, readable, simple, and extensible.


        int number = scanner.nextInt();
        boolean divides5 = number % 5 == 0;
        boolean divides3 = number % 3 == 0;
        String output = divides3 || divides5 ? """" : number + """";

        if( divides5 ) output += ""Fizz"";
        if( divides3 ) output += ""Buzz"";

        System.out.println( output );


We use variables to store our modulus tests and output string.


Then we initialize output to either an empty string or our entered number using ternary. 
Also note that we're casting number as a string by concatenating an empty string literal. 
You can do this many ways, but I like this method for brevity.


Next we have two lines where we concatenate Fizz and Buzz to our empty string. 
Yes you can do this with the combined operator!


Finally we print the output.


What I mean by extensible is that it's clear how we'd add a ""Wazz"" if number is divisible by 2, for example.",positive

"So as I suspected at 1:27:57
What's interesting about computer science and engineering is I seem to learn most effectively by going backwards in time with computers, as an effect, I think I have a full understanding of how the data types are utilized in memory. I've been doing some hobby 8bit computer engineering using integrated circuits and EEPROMs and that helped me fully understand what's going on here when I see it taking place in a programming language.
For example, an int being 4 bytes with the first bit representing a boolean value for positive or negative (which uses 2s compliment to determine negative values). That 4 bytes of data is stored on x memory address as a series of binary 1s or 0s to represent your number for the computer to understand it. so if I wanted to store 30,345 as an int, in binary it would be:
00000000 00000000 01110110 10001001, each space separates a byte (1 byte = 8 bits).
stored in a memory address on my computer.

Seeing the ""byte"" keyword made me take the initiative to prove to myself that this is how it works, so when I tried the method you showed me with a positive 127 which is the max signed number a byte can hold because in binary it's 01111111. When you try 128, you get an exception because in binary, the maximum number you can have in a signed ""byte"" data type is 01111111, not 11111111, as this would make it a -1. It's kinda hard for me to explain, but learning the things I did when prototyping digital circuits helped me understand this way better.",neutral

On the other hand, string equality is defined in terms of the _equals_ method of class _String_ in the _switch_ statement (when the type of _switch_ expression is _String_ ). The first implementation (the one with _if/else if_ statements) fails if the string referenced by the *role* variable is generated at runtime (when it comes from the user, for example). It only works for _interned_ strings.",neutral

"+Programming with Mosh

The location of the curly brace (same line vs. new line) is not a characteristic of Java.  In Java, you can have the curly brace on the same line or in a new line. That kind of misinformation is concerning to me. I paused the video to post this comment so I cannot comment as to the rest of the contents. But six minutes into this video and you are about to lose me.

You also didn't explain well the ""main"" function. In order for the VM to recognize a ""main"" function as the REAL main function, it must have a very specific signature. Anything short than that, like the one you introduced, is simply incorrect.

If your intent is to teach Java to an audience that doesn't know the language, the least you can do is for information to be accurate from the very beginning.",negative

Please make a video on isolation forest,neutral
"Awesome video! You explained the concept so much better than many university lectures. I would just like to make a quick point about the random feature selection step when bootstrapping.

(imho) According to most recent/popular papers on random forest algorithms, the most common and efficient approach appears to randomly select feature subsets at each node when traversing each tree rather than selecting it only once at the tree level.

One explanation I found online is that ""while sampling features at every node still allows the trees to see most variables (in different orders) and learn complex interactions, using a subsample for every tree greatly limits the amount of information that a single tree can learn. This means that trees grown in this fashion are going to be less deep, and with much higher bias, in particular for complex datasets. On the other hand, it is true that trees built this way will tend to be less correlated to each other, as they are often built on completely different subsets of features, but in most scenarios, this will not outweigh the increase in bias, therefore, giving a worse performance on most use cases.""

I really hope this was clear. Any comments are very welcome!",positive
video is awesome!,positive

"this is a really good quick summary of how random forest work. A quick question- during boostrapping, why we do random sampling with replacement, rather than random sampling without replacement? is there any research conducted to demonstrate one is better than the other?",neutral
"Very nice stuff! 
One question, does the random forest include a decision tree trained on the original data? Would it not make sense to include it and actually give it a little more weight than the other trees?

Also, you state that random feature selection helps reduce correlation between trees. So that if you didn't use it, you would end up with very similar trees, and ""that will increase the variance""? Wouldn't rather the opposite be true? Could you help straighten out my intuition here?",neutral

"Great video. But according to some sources, features are are sampled randomly at each node level, not at each tree level. For the first tree, we wouldn't select x0 and x1 for the whole tree, but only for the first node. Then for the second split we would randomly select two features, maybe x0 and x1 but maybe x3 and x2. Is this a variant of the RF algorithm or was my understanding wrong? Do you happen to have a source of the original algorithm?

"When I do NLP processing now, I apply a  Lisp or Prolog based approach where one matches everything at once.  Years ago I learned that to understand a sentence, one must know the words, and to know the words, one must know the sentence.

"Hey I was wondering if anyone has an input on my thoughts on Pi, Phi and the overall introduction of mathematics, numbers and alphabet. Thank you.

Phi depends on .5, Division = Diameter
Diameter = .5 = 1 diameter = 1 degree 

Radius is division of diameter (division of division) 

Phi is diameter x3 divided by/2, 
3 halves, one and a half, 1.5 

Pi is diameter x2 divided by /3, 
2 third, 0.75, one and half of a half 

Phi x3/2
Pi ×2/3 

Pi
1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6...
Phi 
2/1, 3/2, 4/3, 5/4, 6/5... 

Pi is multiplication of radius 
Phi is multiplication of diameter 

Basic principle of dividing/equalizing/sharing something in equal parts (itself) and multiplying something in equal parts (by itself) 

Calculating with circles, squares, triangles, bars, etc... it's very interesting if you think of Greek alphabet for example (Pi and Phi) and the first person to ever have to write ""numbers"" to explain mathematics and wrote it as such 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0... and wonder why it was written precisely like that and if it is a ""how to"" calculate anything using geometry. 

It's easier to see if you put a set square of 360 degrees on a picture of old TVs test pattern for example. 360degrees being 1 circle 

You can calculate anything that way with degrees. You can calculate ""nothing"" precisely in the process, too as the outside of the circle. The TV and computer invention uses the same pattern and algorithm 4:4:4 of 1234 infinitely. 

Using both properly is an algorithm to multiply divisions or divide multiplications infinitely. 

The Greek alphabet letters are ways to calculate that way for specific functions, as well. 

But Pi and Phi are functions. Trying to give it a value would be like trying to give a value to +,×,÷,=,/, etc...",positive

"Unfortunately this example makes no sense and is a good example of why people get so confused when being taught 'by formula'...  Just think about it for a minute...  Imagine that the Prob(Algebra) = 0.3, Prob(Biology) = 0.9 and the Prob(Algebra|Biology) was 0.1...  there is nothing in the definitions above that does not allow for those numbers. However, if you use the 'by formula' approach shown here, you will find that the P(Biology or Algebra) will work out to be 1.11 - which of course is nonsense, as P must be <= 1.  

The problem is that what we actually have here is a sequence of TWO events - i.e. for Sarah to have (Biology AND Algebra) she needs to have chosen Biology and then Algebra (or the other way around). So we have to work out the probabilities of the *four* possible outcomes in THAT sample space, i.e. P(Biology, Algebra), P(Biology, not_Algebra), P(not_Biology, Algebra), P(not_Biology, not_Algebra)...",neutral

"An open letter to those who complain about the content delivery:

Isn't it lucky that the information is being belied in a format where pausing, slowing down, and rewinding are all options? It isn't my intent to offend, but this video probably isn't exactly for you. That isn't to say crash course doesn't want as many people to enjoy their content as possible, but the original purpose was to be a resource for AP student. As someone who is currently in AP Physics and on this unit, this wasn't too fast. That's not to say that students are expected to catch everything just by watching it the first time through. But the students here are either watching it for a preview before class, an additional perspective, or a review before a test. No one is meant to walk away form crash course with a physics major. These are meant to be fast videos to give a basic understanding to curious internet goers and to help students learn and study.

Don't get me wrong, I am picking up on details in this course that had gone right by me when someone tried to cover it in my school days back in the 70's.

I really like physics but I dunno I don't like this series very much...,neutral
"I do not usually watch youtube videos in order to get educated in physics, because I prefer to study by book, since every concept is explained in very detail and it makes it optimal since you can move on, only when you truly understand it, which you can test by solving some problems. 
For me, this video serves as an excellent summary on the topic of rotational motion, since I have already studied it and I was able to get a very good revison by watching it. 

I wrote this comment as a response to people that are saying that they cannot follow this course. Almost nobody can, without pauses, if they are seeing this for the first time, because there are many important concepts to comprehend. 
As a future scientist, my advice is to always study the same material from different sources, because it will give you the best understanding, including CrashCourse, which I  must say, has left a very good impresion on me.",positive

please speak slower and be more clear with the math. why does the wheel have translation motion opposite to the motion. too fast to understand and its so frustrating to just rewind rewind over and over.,neutral

"Now, I can just about manage to follow along with this because I'm quite familiar with the subject matter. If I wasn't, I couldn't. Editing out the time she takes to breathe between sentences, plus the fact that she's already speaking really quickly, makes it impossible to process what she's talking about.",neutral
I'm sure this is Priya from Big Bang Theory,neutral
Wow! Just Wow!!!!!!,neutral
"CrackCourse would be more appropriate. Honestly, how can you call this a course? If you had even the *slightest* awareness on how human beings absorb knowledge, is to plan pauses in your sentences strategically. Of course people *could* rewind stuff again and again, but that's not how the world works. The only people having a benefit out of this are those who are rehearsing for their exams, and those who just want to watch a witty video on a ""sciency"" topic so they can share the fraction of knowledge they've absorbed during the video to their even less educated friends. But a *COURSE*?`A course is about teaching. Rambling through all the information ASAP is not equivalent to that. It can be done fast and efficient, sure. But this is only fast. Not efficient.

I really admire the intent into these videos and a lot of them are good in my opinion. But personally, this one is an example of something that needs some more thought on how to actually efficiently convey information to the viewers.",neutral

"Actually I found this video oversimplified, it treats the angular velocity like a scalar when it's a vector, same with the angular acceleration, and also, the rotation of a body cannot be described by a single angle because our space is in 3D, we need any of these things to describe it:
-Euler angles
-An angle and an axis(this can be described with a single vector that is the product of an unitarian vector by the angle)
-Quaternions
-A rotation matrix",positive
"Two mathematicians decide to have breakfast together. The waiter comes to their table and asks, ""What would you like to eat?"" 
The first mathematician replied, ""I'd like to have r pi."" 
So he got a full round pie which was twice the amount he asked and he was upset. 
His colleague couldn't help but say, ""Stop thinking in circles for one moment will you?""",positive
"Great video, packs in a lot of info and I'm sure many people will need to rewind sections many times to get it all.

One thing I found frustrating was I've never seen anyone treat angular motion from basics using tau instead of 2pi. While all the other references use 2pi, tau is a much more intuitive concept and one far easier for novices to grasp. Sure it's harder for those of us who are already familiar with the subject, but teachers should be making learning easier for their students, not themselves.",neutral
I can't stop watching she is so good at speaking and of course that the beautiful face helps me.,neutral
"In our lessons, we study rotational motion a week before we go to periodic motion ..... but this video sums it up to the point that i need to repeat the video and some parts i missed all over and over again..... but it's awesome to know that the velocity on the point of the wheel at the ground is 0, if and only if it's not slipping forward on its own.",positive

I was in advanced maths class and taking extra physics lessons (for high school exams) and you really can't do one without the other.

(Or at least if we're talking about the calculations part. You could do physics in theory just fine but this crash course is heavily focused on the formulae)

"As a child before I even knew there was such a thing as physics, this puzzled me so much. How was there a small wheel (I was looking at hubcaps) inside a bigger wheel and they both would spin as one yet separated a smaller wheel needs more revolutions to keep up with a wheel of greater diameter. Not in so many words but I must have worried my parents seeing me look at wheels for hours. Kids have it good nowadays. I could have just YouTube searched the answer. xD Love crash course.",positive

"I am so glad that there are video's about this because it is much easyer to rehearse for my exams ( I learned this at school). But because I am not a native english speaker and you speak very fast, I can't follow the video that good. Everything just flies by and it's probably the case for everybody that does not have already learned this. So I'd suggest you make the video a bit longer and speak calmly. It would make more sence because I believe the purpose is to educate people? But again thanks for the hard work you deserve a like.",positive
"Personally I'm no fan of the ADHD editing. There's no breathing room for my brain to process all of the information before the next batch of of information is given. The time between ""scenes"" are shorter than this excellent lecturer's mid sentence pauses. Other than that, great series!",positive
"While I glean the gist of the video, I don't understand why the wheel has a bottom? It cannot be described by gravity, as the astronauts on the moon used the same physics as do the astronauts on the ISS as do we...  Ergo,  is the bottom of the wheel the point at maximum friction?  Or contact point? If that is true, then the contact point could be anywhere on the wheel and from that point all the other forces are calculated?",neutral
"why did you make it so confusing.  You didn't bother to explain the concept of ""relative velocity"".  The reference frame makes all this wheel motion SO much easier to understand.  You made it 200% more complex by not discussing this concept.  The velocity of the wheel is ZERO relative to the ground because it's obviously not slipping, and relative to the center of the wheel it's obviously NOT zero.  It's like you didn't even try and make this easy to understand.  I'm glad I unsubscribed to this channel when this series started.  If the next one is better I will gladly resub.  But I love physics and this entire series sadly is a giant fail if you are actually trying to teach young people physics.  It saddens me.  It's too bad you filmed so many episodes prior to releasing them or you could've read your comments and corrected the problems.  Youtube is all about feedback.  When you produce and film like a television studio you fail to take advantage of the principle mantra of YouTube.  The VIEWERS drive the content.",negative
