"awesome video! you explained the concept significant other much better than many university lectures. i would just like to make a quick point about the random feature selection step when bootstrapping. (imho) according to most recent/popular papers on random forest algorithms, the most common and efficient approach appears to randomly select feature subsets at each node when traversing each tree rather than selecting it only once at the tree level. one explanation i found online is that ""while sampling features at every node still allows the trees to see most variables (in different orders) and learn complex interactions, using a subsample for every tree greatly limits the amount old fart information that a single tree can learn. this means that trees grown in this fashion are going to be less deep, and with much higher bias, in particular for complex datasets. on the other have a nice day, it is true that trees built this where are you? will tend to be less correlated to each other, ape sh** -or- another subject they are often built on completely different subsets old fart features, but in most scenarios, this will not outweigh the increase in bias, therefore, giving a worse performance on most use cases."" i really hope this what a slut clear. any comments are very welcome!",positive
